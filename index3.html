            <h1>Why am I joining Gaza Sky Geeks ?</h1>
            <h3>Motivation Statement</h3>
            <p >
                During the past two years, I entered the programming world and made a great personal effort to reach what I am today in this knowledge of programming(youtube was a good teacher through my learning journey), but always  something was missing, I needed someone to guide me in the programming world  to reach the level I want to be at and also improve my personality . 
                When I heard about Gaza Sky Geeks and read about the programs that Its progress I knew it was what I needed to develop my programming skills.<br>
                I have joined the academy with deep intentions to grow my skills as well as my personality. Therefore, my vision and mission has been set to apply all what I have learned into the practical field I'm about to enter. 
                <br>
                I'm looking forward to develop and expand the technology as much as what the coming era could demand from us we the programers
                I always wanted to make a difference in the community and here I am having the chance to do so</p>
                <h3>Ambition Statement</h3>
                <p>
                    After Code Academy, I want to get into something real in programming!<br>
                    I want to start using my new skills and make sure they are up to date
                    Start developing my own apps, see if what I learned on the course or in the classroom applies to the real world too I want to participate in a hackathons
                    a great way to get together with teams of creators and get started coding, It's a social experiment as well as a good way to take my coding to the next level.<br>
                    I finally aspire to get my dream job in one of the major international companies as a programmer.</p>
